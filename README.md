As we are moving towards a greener future, the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in increasing day-by-day. But the production of electric vehicles consumes a lot of oil. And most electricity generation plants in the US (and the world) still run on oil. How are they interrelated then? Will the increase in number of EVs on road increase the global oil production?

These are the questions that Team Fighting Mongooses is trying to answer by building a model for the relationship between EVs and Global Oil Consumption and then simulating it till 2050, the supposedly green era we are all waiting for.
